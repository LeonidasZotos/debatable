# Debatable
Given a news story, it is inevitable that different news outlets cover the story from different viewpoints, potentially omitting parts of it (either intentionally or unintentionally). However, it is important for a reader to be well-informed and aware of all parts of the story. Unfortunately, this takes time and effort as the reader has to manually find and read different sources that cover the same topic. Admittedly, this is cumbersome and is something not many people do.

The proposed solution is a software product that:

1. Given a link to a news article, it finds other articles that cover the same topic.
2. Is able to detect (dis)similarity between news articles, in terms of content. Using that, it can suggest to the reader which articles they should read to receive a good picture of the topic.
3. (ambitious goal) Is able to make a compilation of sentences/paragraphs from different articles, so that the compilation covers as much information as possible with little repetition.

The goal of the list above is to guide the development of the project with concrete milestones, rather than function as a checklist of necessary functions. Through the development of the product it will become clear what is and what is not feasible with the limited time.
